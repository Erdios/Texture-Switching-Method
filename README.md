# Texture-Switching-Method

The project is an experimental project for a VR foveated texturing method.

Framework of this project is based on a [real-time ventral metamer](https://vr-unity-viewer.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) project.

## Platform
Unity 2021

OpenVR

## What it does

Similar textures in the periphery will be changed to one low-quality texture to reduce draw call.

The project doesn't work well yet though...

Visual experience and rendering performance still needs to be improved.
